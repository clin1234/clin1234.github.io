# About Me

I am a student at Rollins College pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with special interests in compilers, interpreters, and systems programming.
Also fond of quips in Latin.

At the moment, my primary development environment is Windows 10 Pro Insider Edition. I eventually plan to migrate to Linux, perhaps a Gentoo-based distribution or Fedora Rawhide, assuming no previous technical debt prevents such migration. For detractors:

Quisne novitas vexatura dubitat.

<p>I really wish there is a Latin locale somewhere...</p>
