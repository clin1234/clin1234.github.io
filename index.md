# Minimal and Spiffy Personal Website

As a news program would say: Wilkommen zu Tagesschau. Heut in Studio, _insert anchor here_.

## Links (Pun is intentional.)

*   [Code for my website](https://github.com/clin1234/clin1234.github.io)
*   [zlite library](https://github.com/clin1234/zlite)
* [NMS](https://github.com/clin1234/NMS) a proof of concept Minesweeper-like clone with multiplayer support. Still in progress.

# Rollins-related stuff

As a member of the local ACM chapter, this serves as a repository for personal projects and pursuits otherwise "taxing" for the college's technical resources, in the views of the IT Department. **I vehemently disagree.**

## 

*   [Slack page](https://acm2019-20.slack.com)
* [ACM Discord Server](insert link for now)

# Magic: the Gathering

* [r/mtgfinance](https://reddit.com/r/mtgfinance) Subreddit for speculation on the game's secondary market.
* [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) Search cards easily. Much better than the official Gatherer. 

A gem from the 26th IOCCC:
```c
    static int e,n,j,o,y;int main(){for(++o;(n=-~getchar());e+=11==n,y++)o=n>0xe^012>n&&'`'^n^65?!n:!o?++j:o;printf("%8d%8d%8d\n",e^n,j+=!o&&y,y);}
```

Formatted for readability:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    static int e, n, j, o, y;
    int main() {
        for (++o; (n = -~getchar()); ((e += (11 == n)), y++))
            o = ((n > 0xe) ^ (012 > n)) && ('`' ^ n ^ 65) ? (!n) : (!o ? (++j) : o);
        printf("%8d%8d%8d\n", e^n, j += (!o && y), y);
    }
```

This is an implementation of `wc`. To explain:
1. While 
Note that input is limited to 99,999,999 bytes.
2. Outputs the number of newlines, number of words, and number of bytes (`y`).
