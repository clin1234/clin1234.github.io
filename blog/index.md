# Utterances of a Cynic

## My experience at Vanderbilt
Posted on 8/08/2022.

### TODO:
For some reason I can't scale down images yet to fit with this article. Mainly because
the images I took were in the HEIC format (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format#Support)),
and current web browsers don't support it natively, at least on Linux.

## The impact of my internship experience

To sum up in one word: *Wonderous*. Not only did I relish in collaborating with a graduate student who have published numerous papers on the field of computer-enhanced vision, but also indulged in engaging with both the academic and social summer-time atmosphere found within the university, including gazing at the Central Library, shown below:

## Would I have pursued this internship without external funding?

Without the funding, I would have not pursued it, or any other internship not within
driving distance from Central Florida. One major disincentive that the Gateway Fellows program
dispeled was my transportation and lodging costs, both to arrive at Nashville, and the
quotidian driving in the city.

And before you ask, I chose to lodge at a hotel some distance away from the city center,
mainly because of (perhaps apocryphal) concerns about abnormally high rowdiness during
nights. That choice was not cheap: the total price for my nearly 2 month stay totaled close
to ~$3,200.

## Lessons learned

* Unity's AR/VR plug-in is rather fickle to manage, at least initially. Hopefully later
Unity releases improve this
* Ethical considerations for testing volunteers on virtual environments don't surprisingly
differ too significantly from studies in the hard sciences
* Internet speeds provided by anywhere else, including fast-food restaurants, public libraries,
and the university, feel relieving compared to both the hotel's Wi-Fi and my "ultrafast"
5G mobile Internet.

## Examples of growth

* Learned how to create and test AR environments in Unity
* With the supervisor's encouragement, I went through Google Scholars to read on not
only her papers, but also those published by other eminent researchers on both augmented
reality and computer-enhanced vision.

## Future plans

After graduation in December, I intend to pursue full-time employment at niche, yet
intriguing tech companies in specialized fields. Possible candidates include fintech (JPMorgan & Chase, Bloomberg), and quant-based (Two Sigma).
