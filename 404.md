# HTTP Error Code 404: Not Found

Well, that was disappointing. In the meantime, refer to [this spiffy RFC document](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4).

To quote:
> The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
> not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
> willing to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not
> indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or
> permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the
> origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that
> the condition is likely to be permanent.

>   A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
> indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
> Section 4.2.2 of [RFC7234]).
