# Projects

About high time I mentioned them:

* [md5cpp](https://github.com/clin1234/md5cpp): A C++ library able to parse Common Markdown, alongside a few extensions. Derived from [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c)
* [ATG](https://github.com/clin1234/ATG): CMS 270 final project and automatic exam randomizer and grader. Uses recent Java features and Swing.
* [IBM Capstone](https://github.com/clin1234/IBM_AI_Workflow_Capstone): capstone project that demonstrates training models on time-series data. Uses scikit-learn.
* [Captain Stack](https://github.com/clin1234/copilot-clone): extension for VSCode and compatibles (I use VSCodium for Captain Stack's development) that mimics GitHub's Copilot by aggregating StackOverflow answers for code completion. Typescript source is transpiled to JS.
* [LibreOffice AppImages](https://github.com/clin1234/libreoffice-appimage): daily bleeding-edge builds of LibreOffice in AppImage format.
* [Unoffical Discord client](https://github.com/clin1234/unofficial-discord-client): desktop-based Discord client written in C++, Qt, and QML.
* [ILSpy]: a fork of ILSpy that bumps the .NET SDK version to 6.x, mainly for new C# features.
